# MusicMakerRandomize

This mod adds a new song to the Music Maker, which will play a random available song each time you return to the crossroads.

## Configuration

By default, the mod will only randomize from unlocked songs. You can change this behaviour by setting the `AllSongs` option to true in `config.lua`.
