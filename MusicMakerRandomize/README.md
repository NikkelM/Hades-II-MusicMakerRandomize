# MusicMakerRandomize

This mod adds a new song to the Music Maker, which will play a random available song each time you return to the crossroads.

## Installation

Download both the [Hades II Mod Importer](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades2/mods/1) and the [Mod Util](https://github.com/SGG-Modding/ModUtil/releases/latest) and follow their respective installation instruction.

Then place the `MusicMakerRandomize` folder in the `Mods` folder of your Hades II Content folder, and run `modimporter.exe` to apply it.

To uninstall, either remove the folder or set the `Enabled` option in `config.lua` to false, then re-run `modimporter.exe`.

## Configuration

By default, the mod will only randomize from unlocked songs. You can change this behaviour by setting the `AllSongs` option to true in `config.lua`.
